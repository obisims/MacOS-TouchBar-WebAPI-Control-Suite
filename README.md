## What's even the point?

### <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/12121388895" target="_blank">I â™¥ï¸Ž spotify duh</a> but also...
So last week i smashed the screen of my 2015 macbook Pro (still sour) which led to a replacement which had one of these touch bars that i didn't see much utility in until i saw Better Touch Tools and checked out My Touchbar. My Rules. which got me excited to do something with it and the main thing that i do on my computer, regardless of task, is listen to spotify.

Unfortunately MTMR's custom stuff runs on AppleScript and Spotify doesn't dig that too much, thankfully we can give their WebAPI a reach-around with Python using Spotipy which gives us a more reasonable control to our spotify experience.

## WTF is going on?
> Generally MTMR is being told what to do with applescript, and we have our applescript launching python which is talking to spotify's webApi through spotipy and then handing info back to the applescript if needed.

## Install Notes
Will add to, still need to figure out what the easiest way to move it around is. So far i think it's this?
### Changes to files
#### spotipy filepath
all `API_XXX.scpt` files need the `pythonpath` changed to wherever your spotipy installation directory is.
```applescript
set pythonPath to (the POSIX path of (path to home folder)) & "{path to spotipy-master}"
```
#### spotify API creds
this section of `AuthedSpotifyObjectTemplate.py` needs to be filled out and retitled `AuthedSpotifyObject.py`
```python
CLIENT_ID = "{YOUR CLIENT ID}"
CLIENT_SECRET = "{YOUR CLIENT SECRET}"
username = "{YOUR USERNAME}"
```
#### movingFiles
idk what is needed but here is where i'm putting stuff
`Checkers`&`Actions` folders into `/Users/mohawkmogwai/Documents/Coding/github/MacOS-TouchBar-WebAPI-Control-Suite/`, you will need to change this path in the `.json` to wherever your `MacOS-TouchBar-WebAPI-Control-Suite` dir is.
`Spotipy_TouchBar` folder into `.../spotipy` dir.
